1. CASUAL
Given 2 integers.

Add one to the other.
Save the result to a variable.

Return the local variable evaluated to the saved result.

FORMAL
START

# Given 2 integers called number1 and number2

SET result = number1 + number2

PRINT result

END

2. CASUAL
Given an array of strings.

Iterate through the array one by one.
  - save the first value of the array as the starting value.
  - for each iteration except the first, concat the saved value with the current iteration.
  - reassign the saved value as the concatenated value.

After iterating through the array, return the saved value.

FORMAL
START

# Given an array of string called "arr"

SET saved_value = value within the arr array at space 1
SET iterator = 1

WHILE iterator < length of arr
  SET result = saved_value + value within arr array at space "iterator"
  reassign saved_value as result

  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT result

END

3. CASUAL
Given an array of intergers.

Make a new blank array.

Iterate through the given array one by one.
  - for each iteration check the space of the current value within the array.
  - if the space at which the current value is present is odd
    - add the current value to the new array
  - if the space at which the current value is present is even
    - move to the next value

After iterating through the array, return the new array.

FORMAL
START

# Given an array of intergers called "arr"

SET new_arr = []
SET counter = 0

WHILE counter <= length of arr
  iterate through the values within arr
  IF counter is odd
    new_arr << current value
  ELSE
    go to the next iteration
  
  counter = counter + 1

PRINT new_arr
